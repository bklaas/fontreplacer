# fontreplacer

This is a Squeezebox Applet, which will only work on the following SqueezeOS-based Squeezeboxes:
* Squeezebox Radio
* Squeezebox Touch
* Squeezebox Controller

The default FreeSans Font in the stock firmware for these squeezeboxes does not provide Unicode support.

The applet replaces the default FreeSans Font with a merged FreeSans + DroidSansFallback font to provide a fuller character set, including Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters.
